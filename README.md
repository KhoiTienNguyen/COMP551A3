# COMP551A3
In this project, we were tasked to implement Multi Layers Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network classification models to classify the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The
Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of over 70,000 example of
28x28 grayscale images over 10 classes. Our goal was to
implement a Multi Layer Perceptron and a Convolutional
Neural Network that correctly classifies the images. We implemented the models with different hyper-parameters to
find the best performing models. In fact, we found the best
performing multilayer perceptron to be a two hidden layer
model which uses logistic activation function, trained with
learning rate of 1.5 and mini-batch with batch size of 16.
After 250 iterations, we achieved an accuracy of 82.34%.
Our CNN with dropout model on the other hand, had a performance of 91.88% test accuracy. Overall, our CNN implementation performed the best
